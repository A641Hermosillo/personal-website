         <p>James was selected by his hometown team, the Cleveland Cavaliers, as the first overall pick of the 2003 NBA draft.[28] In his first regular season game, he scored 25 points against the Sacramento Kings, setting an NBA record for most points scored by a prep-to-pro player in his debut performance.[29] At the conclusion of the season, he became the first Cavalier to receive the NBA Rookie of the Year Award,[30] and with final averages of 20.9 points, 5.5 rebounds, and 5.9 assists per game, he also became just the third player in league history to average at least 20 points, 5 rebounds, and 5 assists per game as a rookie.[31] Cleveland ultimately finished the season 35â€“47, failing to make the playoffs despite an 18-game improvement over the previous year.</p>
